📞 Customer Call List Data Cleaning Project

This project is designed to practice data cleaning techniques in Python using pandas. The dataset simulates a customer call list, and the goal is to transform raw data into a cleaner, more structured format that is ready for analysis.

🔍 Project Objectives

Dataset Exploration & Overview

Load the dataset with pandas.

View the first/last few rows and dataset summary.

Understand dataset shape (rows, columns).

Check & Fix Data Types

Inspect column data types.

Convert incorrect data types (e.g., phone numbers, dates, numeric values stored as strings).

Handle Duplicates & Missing Values

Detect and remove duplicate rows.

Identify missing values.

Apply suitable techniques (drop, fill, or replace).

Standardize Categorical Columns

Normalize inconsistent values (e.g., "NY", "New York", "newyork" → "New York").

Strip extra spaces, fix capitalization, and unify formats.

Feature Engineering

Create new columns based on existing data. Examples:

Extract area code from phone number.

Categorize customers by region.

Derive customer contact status.

Final Clean Dataset

Ensure data consistency and readability.

Export cleaned data to CSV/Excel for further analysis.
